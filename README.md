## Info
For the best experience i recommend using Firefox browser because chromium browsers relies on that the computer have enough emojis which makes some emojis not display correctly. In a final product we will actually be using images instead of emojis.

## Getting Started


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
