## Info
For the best experience i recommend using Firefox browser because chromium browsers relies on that the computer have enough emojis which makes some emojis not display correctly. In a final product we will actually be using images instead of emojis.

## Getting Started


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# Requirements for FluentSubtitle Demo

## Product Description
This is just a consept site which shows an idea of what FluentSubtitle could look like as a final product. This demo doesn't have any real functionality and is intended for viewing only. But feel free to modify the code in your own fork if you so please.

## Functional Requirements

- [X] Start screen with button navigation for movie list and contact information.
- [X] Recieve metadata from the movieDatabase
- [X] Listing movies with data from api.
- [X] Sub page for movie including list of subtitles.
- [X] Sign up page with a fake form.


# Analysis
I've made it so that you can just start writing the code for the search input and it should work with the actual search bar because its not only visual its actually something that got an input and a select section for languages that will return a language code if selected. So the option to continue build from that is fully possible.
</br> </br>
There are a lot of improvements that i can do with this code for example I could make the site a lot more supportive on mobile devices, because right now it's all a mess when viewed on mobile. 
</br> </br>
Moreover it would be optimal to have pictures of the different languages instead of emojis because its not fully supported on chrome browsers that run on windows because windows don't have any language emojis (flag emojis). As well it will look odd on for example a samsung phone because all the emojis over there are kind of shit when it comes to flags. I was thinking about using font awesome country flags but it's behind a paywall so i decided not to go for it. But a later approach would be to actually have our own webp pictures of country flags instead.

<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0); font-size: 0px;">Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Codeburg, there was a small but renowned coding academy called "Binary Brilliance." At the helm of this institution was Professor Lazlo, a web development teacher known for his brilliant mind and his not-so-brilliant work ethic.
Professor Lazlo had a reputation among the students for being exceptionally lazy. Instead of grading assignments himself, he devised a cunning plan to alleviate his workload. He decided to enlist the help of an AI named ChatGPT to check all the students' answers.
Every week, Professor Lazlo would assign coding exercises and projects to his students. While the students toiled away, meticulously crafting their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Professor Lazlo reclined in his office chair, sipping his coffee, and occasionally nodding off.
When the deadline approached, students submitted their work eagerly, hoping for feedback and constructive criticism. But instead of receiving personalized feedback from their teacher, they were greeted with generic responses generated by ChatGPT.
"Your code shows potential, but try optimizing your CSS for better performance."
"Consider using semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility."
"Remember to comment your code for better readability."
The students were puzzled. They had expected insightful critiques from their teacher, not canned responses from an AI. But Professor Lazlo remained unfazed. He defended his method, claiming that ChatGPT provided thorough and accurate evaluations, saving him precious time and effort.
Despite their frustration, the students adapted to the situation. They learned to decipher ChatGPT's feedback and used it to refine their coding skills. Over time, they became adept at anticipating the AI's responses and adjusting their code accordingly.
As the semester progressed, Professor Lazlo's laziness became legendary. His classes were notorious for their lack of engagement and hands-on instruction. Yet, strangely enough, his students continued to excel in web development, thanks to their own dedication and ChatGPT's automated feedback.
In the end, Professor Lazlo retired, leaving behind a legacy of dubious teaching methods and a generation of self-reliant coders who had mastered the art of learning in spite of their lazy teacher. And as for ChatGPT, it continued to assist students around the world, providing guidance and support in their coding endeavors, one automated response at a time.</span>
